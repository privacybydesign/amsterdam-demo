Try out Yivi first? Please find various demos to find out how Yivi works. Use your own details to see the demos. The City of Amsterdam will not store this data.

- Your address

You can add your personal data and address to Yivi by logging in once with your DigiD at the Municipality of Nijmegen. So you won't login to the Muncipality of Amsterdam.  The Municipality of Nijmegen issues data of the Municipal Personal Records Database (Basisregistratie Personen - BRP) to all Yivi users.

The **Give Yivi a try** website uses the most recent technology and web standards. The outdated Microsoft Internet Explorer browser is becoming less and less suitable. Supporting the browser is therefore an obstacle for the purpose of optimizing the functionality of the site.
In practical terms, the non-support of Internet Explorer means that the site would work much more slowly than in modern browsers, that pages would look different to how they have been designed, and that more complex functions (in the interactive map, for example) would not work properly.
If you are still using Internet Explorer, you are advised to change to a different browser, such as [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/new/) or [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/nl_nl/chrome/). Microsoft itself [advises](https://docs.microsoft.com/nl-nl/lifecycle/faq/internet-explorer-microsoft-edge#what-is-the-lifecycle-policy-for-internet-explorer) the use of a different browser.`,

        intro: `# Complete accessibility statement
**The City of Amsterdam would like everyone to be able to use the ‚ÄòGive IRMA a try‚Äô website.**`,
        article: `
## Accessible ‚ÄòGive Yivi a try‚Äô
Everyone should be able to use local and central government websites. This is what we are aiming to achieve, by making ‚ÄòGive Yivi a try‚Äô accessible to everyone, and keeping it that way:
- We are developing ‚ÄòGive Yivi a try‚Äô in partnership with you, the people of Amsterdam.
- We regularly carry out user surveys and test the accessibility of ‚ÄòGive Yivi a try‚Äô.
- We resolve any problem areas.
- Our employees keep their knowledge about accessibility up to date.
## Areas that are not yet accessible
- If style sheets are deactivated, the Yivi QR code appears at the bottom of the page. In that case, the QR code can only get focus using the keyboard.
- In the Usabilla feedback panel, the ‚ÄòPowered by GetFeedback‚Äô text is lacking a 'UK‚Äô language attribute.
- In the Usabilla feedback panel, ‚ÄòReporting something specific‚Äô is not clearly recognizable for a screen reader.\n
Have you found a page that you cannot read or use? Please let us know, using our [contact form](https://formulieren.amsterdam.nl/TripleForms/DirectRegelen/formulier/nl-NL/evAmsterdam/Klachtenformulier.aspx).
## What can you expect from us?
- You will receive confirmation of receipt within five working days.
- We will inform you about our progress and the outcome.
- Your request will be dealt with within three weeks.\n
## Enforcement procedure
Are you dissatisfied about how your question or complaint has been dealt with? Or have we not responded on time?
If so, you can get in touch using the [National ombudsman complaints form](https://www.nationaleombudsman.nl/klacht-indienen/uw-klacht).
## Accessibility statement
The ‚ÄòGive Yivi a try‚Äô website is in partial compliance with the Decree on Digital Accessibility of the Government.
The accessibility statement is available in the [Register van toegankelijkheidsverklaringen (register of accessibility statements)](https://www.toegankelijkheidsverklaring.nl/register/4096).
This statement is based on the [‚ÄòGive Yivi a try‚Äô accessibility check](/assets/toegankelijkheidscheck_website_Probeer_IRMA_uit.pdf). This check includes all WCAG 2.1 success criteria on which this website has been tested.
